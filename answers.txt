What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

 Programming can be seen as a subset of software engineering, a craft focused on the art of writing code, and the primary concern is to have all the code functions as intended, solving specific problems, or performing certain operations.

 On the other hand, software engineering encompasses a broader spectrum, which includes not only the act of writing code but also the structured process of developing, maintaining, and managing software projects.


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
 
  Waterfall
 The waterfall model arranges all the phases sequentially so that each new phase depends on the outcome of the previous phase. Conceptually, the design flows from one phase down to the next, like that of a waterfall.

 Pros and cons
 The waterfall model provides discipline to project management and gives a tangible output at the end of each phase. However, there is little room for change once a phase is considered complete, as changes can affect the software's delivery time, cost, and quality. Therefore, the model is most suitable for small software development projects, where tasks are easy to arrange and manage and requirements can be pre-defined accurately.

 Iterative
 The iterative process suggests that teams begin software development with a small subset of requirements. Then, they iteratively enhance versions over time until the complete software is ready for production. The team produces a new software version at the end of each iteration.

 Pros and cons
 Itâ€™s easy to identify and manage risks, as requirements can change between iterations. However, repeated cycles could lead to scope change and underestimation of resources.

 Spiral
 The spiral model combines the iterative model's small repeated cycles with the waterfall model's linear sequential flow to prioritize risk analysis. You can use the spiral model to ensure software's gradual release and improvement by building prototypes at each phase.

 Pros and cons
 The spiral model is suitable for large and complex projects that require frequent changes.
  However, it can be expensive for smaller projects with a limited scope.

 Agile
 The agile model arranges the SDLC phases into several development cycles. The team iterates through the phases rapidly, delivering only small, incremental software changes in each cycle. They continuously evaluate requirements, plans, and results so that they can respond quickly to change. The agile model is both iterative and incremental, making it more efficient than other process models.

 Pros and cons
 Rapid development cycles help teams identify and address issues in complex projects early on and before they become significant problems.
  They can also engage customers and stakeholders to obtain feedback throughout the project lifecycle. However, overreliance on customer feedback could lead to excessive scope changes or end the project midway.
